Preface: Is bowling one of your hobbies or interests?
-----------------------------------------------------

![Bowling ball and pins](assets/bowling-pins.jpg)

### Who do you picture as a bowler?

Based on Google image searches alone, bowling might not be particularly
diverse:

![Google Image results from the search “person bowler,” predominantly
featuring older, white men](assets/person-bowler.png)

### Why ask?

![Bowling score card](assets/bowling-score.png)

A **bowling score calculator is a prototypical assignment** for
introductory programming courses.

However, it may also be the epitome of an application of coding that
**lacks broad appeal** and may **reinforce stereotypes** of coding
classes’ target audiences.

Research Questions
------------------

Investigated the following research questions:

1.  What *popular interests* do students perceive as **relevant** to
    CS/coding?
2.  What *popular interests* do students perceive as **not relevant** to
    CS/coding?
3.  Are there differences in **how interested different genders and
    races** are in common CS1 applications?
4.  Are there interests that **uniquely appeal to gender and racial
    minorities**?

Method
------

At **California State University-Chico** (Chico State)

-   Predominantly undergraduate institution
-   Hispanic-Serving Institution
-   Computer Science department, within *College of Engineering,
    Computer Science, & Construction Management* (ECC)

We surveyed students in a **CS1 course**

-   CSCI 111 - Programming and Algorithms I (in C++)
-   Required for BS in Computer Science, Computer Information Systems
-   Also serves many other majors, both within and outside of the
    College of ECC

Survey included these items:

-   What is your major? *(Free response)*
-   Gender *(Select one from…)*
    1.  Female,
    2.  Male,
    3.  Non-binary,
    4.  Prefer not to say,
    5.  Other *\[with free response\]*
-   Race *(select all that apply)*
    1.  American Indian or Alaska Native,
    2.  Asian,
    3.  Black or African American,
    4.  Hispanic or Latin American,
    5.  Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander,
    6.  White,
    7.  Other *\[with free response\]*
-   **What are your hobbies and interests?** (separate by commas) *(Free
    response)*
-   **Of those hobbies and interests, which do you believe can be
    relevant to Computer Science or programming?** *(Free response)*

We gathered **198** student responses over two semesters, with the
following demographics:

-   **Gender**:
    -   Majority: 154 *Male* (78%),
    -   Minority: 41 *Female* (21%), 1 *Non-binary* (&lt;1%),
    -   Excluded: 1 *Prefer not to say* (&lt;1%), 1 *no response*
        (&lt;1%)
-   **Race**:
    -   Majority: 119 *White* and/or *Asian* (60%),
    -   Minority: 77 One or more identified: *American Indian or Alaska
        Native, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latin American,
        Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, Other* (39%)
    -   Excluded: 2 *no response* (1%)

Results
-------

We used *Grounded Theory* thematic analysis to identify categories from
free responses:

-   **Games** - video games, tabletop games, puzzles, etc
-   **Reading** - reading any sort of literature
-   **Arts and Crafts** - drawing, knitting, etc.
-   **Music, Film, and audio/video** - consuming, creating, or editing
    music, movies, etc.
-   **Athletics** - sports and fitness activities, either watching or
    participating
-   **Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM)** - specific
    fields (e.g. Biology, Statistics, etc), building computers, and
    electronics
-   **Other academic disciplines (non-STEM)** - any fields not
    traditionally identified as STEM
-   **Socializing** - time or activities with friends and family
-   **Sleep and relaxation** - all forms of resting
-   **Animals** - interacting or taking care of pets, livestock, or
    other animals
-   **Culinary** - cooking, eating, and drinking
-   **Fashion and cosmetics** - makeup, clothes, accessories; studying,
    shopping, or wearing
-   **Nature and outdoors** - camping, fishing, and other outdoor
    activities that concentrate on nature
-   **Travel** - vacations, road trips, domestic and international
    exploration
-   **Automotive** - driving, fixing, and customizing any automobiles

### Students’ Interests and Perceived Relevance to CS

The following table summarizes students’ responses, and whether they
indicated that they considered each interest relevant to CS or
programming.

#### RQ1. What popular interests do students perceive as relevant to CS/coding?

Only topics that the majority of interested students thought could be
related to CS:

-   STEM (98%)
-   Games (83%)
-   Other Academic Disciplines (70%)
-   Automotive (50%)

Only **STEM** and **Games** were mentioned by at least a quarter of the
students **and** were considered relevant by most of those interested in
them.

#### RQ2. What popular interests do students perceive as not relevant to CS/coding?

**Athletics**; **music/film/audio/visuals**; and **nature and the
outdoors** garnered interest from at least a quarter of the students,
but most of those interested did not perceive them as relevant to CS.

How can we relate other interests to coding?

-   Does it **involve information**?
-   Can that information be used to **discover new things** or **solve
    problems**?

…if so, there are possible coding applications!

### Interest by Demographic

We also investigated the percentage of students who identified an
interest, by gender and racial majority/minority demographics as well as
by major.

#### RQ3. Are there differences in how interested different genders and races are in common CS1 applications?

Common applications in CS1 include **games**,
**robots/microcontrollers**, and **media computation**. We evaluated
interest in each independently, using chi-square goodness of fit tests
to compare proportions of interest between majority and minority
students.

1.  **Games**
    -   Gender majority (n=104, 68%) vs minority (n=15, 36%). Interest
        was **significantly disproportionate** (*χ*<sup>2</sup>=5.50,
        df=1, p&lt;.05).
    -   Racial majority (n=76, 64%) vs minority (n=43, 56%). No
        significant difference (*χ*<sup>2</sup>=0.50, df=1, p=.48)
2.  **Robots/microcontrollers** - evaluated with STEM interests
    -   Gender majority (n=55, 36%) vs minority (n=6, 14%). Interest was
        **significantly disproportionate** (*χ*<sup>2</sup>=4.87,df=1,
        p&lt;.05).
    -   Racial majority (n=42, 35%) vs minority (n=19, 25%). No
        significant difference (*χ*<sup>2</sup>=1.69, df=1, p=.19)
3.  **Media computation** - evaluated with Music/film/audio/visuals
    -   Gender majority (n=51, 33%) vs minority (n=16, 38%). No
        significant difference (*χ*<sup>2</sup>=0.24,df=1, p=.62)
    -   Racial majority (n=37, 31%) vs minority (n=30, 39%). No
        significant difference (*χ*<sup>2</sup>=0.85, df=1, p=.36).

#### RQ4. Are there interests that uniquely appeal to gender and racial minorities?

-   **Gender minority**
    -   *Athletics* was the most popular interest
    -   *Music/film/audio/visual* and *Arts/crafts* garnered more
        interest than majority counterparts
-   **Racial minority**
    -   Proportionate interest in *athletics*,
        *music/film/audio/visual*, and *arts/crafts*
    -   More interest in *reading*, *socializing*, *culinary*, and
        *sleeping/relaxing* than majority counterparts

Conclusions
-----------

-   Games and STEM applications may be engaging to the current majority
    of students
    -   *but* emphasis on these applications are not as likely to
        interest women and other gender minorities. They may even be an
        *impediment* to broadening participation.
-   Interests expressed reinforce that *media computation* is a broadly
    appealing application of coding
-   *Many interests are untapped* in making coding relevant and
    meaningful
-   Future work in broadening participation through examples of more
    inclusive coding applications that are relevant to students’ lives
    -   *Coming soon to SIGCSE 2022…*
