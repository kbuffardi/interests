## Preface: Is bowling one of your hobbies or interests?

![Bowling ball and pins](assets/bowling-pins.jpg)

### Who do you picture as a bowler?

Based on Google image searches alone, bowling might not be particularly diverse:

![Google Image results from the search "person bowler," predominantly featuring older, white men](assets/person-bowler.png)


### Why ask?

![Bowling score card](assets/bowling-score.png)

A **bowling score calculator is a prototypical assignment** for introductory programming courses.

However, it may also be the epitome of an application of coding that **lacks broad appeal** and may **reinforce stereotypes** of coding classes' target audiences.


## Research Questions

Investigated the following research questions:

1. What *popular interests* do students perceive as **relevant** to CS/coding? 
2. What *popular interests* do students perceive as **not relevant** to CS/coding?
3. Are there differences in **how interested different genders and races** are in common CS1 applications?
4. Are there interests that **uniquely appeal to gender and racial minorities**?

## Method

At **California State University-Chico** (Chico State)

* Predominantly undergraduate institution
* Hispanic-Serving Institution
* Computer Science department, within *College of Engineering, Computer Science, & Construction Management* (ECC)

We surveyed students in a **CS1 course**

* CSCI 111 - Programming and Algorithms I (in C++)
* Required for BS in Computer Science, Computer Information Systems
* Also serves many other majors, both within and outside of the College of ECC

Survey included these items:

* What is your major? *(Free response)*
* Gender *(Select one from...)*
  1. Female,
  2. Male,
  3. Non-binary,
  4. Prefer not to say,
  5. Other *[with free response]*
* Race *(select all that apply)*
  1. American Indian or Alaska Native,
  2. Asian,
  3. Black or African American, 
  4. Hispanic or Latin American, 
  5. Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander,
  6. White, 
  7. Other *[with free response]*
* **What are your hobbies and interests?** (separate by commas) *(Free response)*
* **Of those hobbies and interests, which do you believe can be relevant to Computer Science or programming?** *(Free response)*

We gathered **198** student responses over two semesters, with the following demographics:

* **Gender**: 
  * Majority: 154 *Male* (78%),
  * Minority: 41 *Female* (21%), 1 *Non-binary* (<1%), 
  * Excluded: 1 *Prefer not to say* (<1%), 1 *no response* (<1%)
* **Race**:
  * Majority: 119 *White* and/or *Asian* (60%),
  * Minority: 77 One or more identified: *American Indian or Alaska Native, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latin American, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander, Other* (39%)
  * Excluded: 2 *no response* (1%)

## Results

We used *Grounded Theory* thematic analysis to identify categories from free responses:

* **Games** - video games, tabletop games, puzzles, etc
* **Reading** - reading any sort of literature
* **Arts and Crafts** - drawing, knitting, etc.
* **Music, Film, and audio/video** - consuming, creating, or editing music, movies, etc.
* **Athletics** - sports and fitness activities, either watching or participating
* **Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM)** - specific fields (e.g. Biology, Statistics, etc), building computers, and electronics
* **Other academic disciplines (non-STEM)** - any fields not traditionally identified as STEM
* **Socializing** - time or activities with friends and family
* **Sleep and relaxation** - all forms of resting
* **Animals** - interacting or taking care of pets, livestock, or other animals
* **Culinary** - cooking, eating, and drinking
* **Fashion and cosmetics** - makeup, clothes, accessories; studying, shopping, or wearing
* **Nature and outdoors** - camping, fishing, and other outdoor activities that concentrate on nature
* **Travel** - vacations, road trips, domestic and international exploration
* **Automotive** - driving, fixing, and customizing any automobiles

### Students' Interests and Perceived Relevance to CS

The following table summarizes students' responses, and whether they indicated that they considered each interest relevant to CS or programming.

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(DT)
```
```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
relevance <- read.csv("relevance.csv")
colnames(relevance) <- c("Interest","Relevant","Not Relevant","% Relevant")
relevance$`Total` <- relevance$`Relevant` + relevance$`Not Relevant`
datatable(relevance, options = list(
  searching = FALSE,
  pageLength = 15,
  paging=FALSE
  )
)
```

#### RQ1. What popular interests do students perceive as relevant to CS/coding?

Only topics that the majority of interested students thought could be related to CS:

* STEM	(98%)
*	Games	(83%)
*	Other Academic Disciplines (70%)
*	Automotive (50%)

Only **STEM** and **Games** were mentioned by at least a quarter of the students **and** were considered relevant by most of those interested in them.

#### RQ2. What popular interests do students perceive as not relevant to CS/coding?

**Athletics**; **music/film/audio/visuals**; and **nature and the outdoors** 
garnered interest from at least a quarter of the students, but most of those interested did not perceive them as relevant to CS.

How can we relate other interests to coding?

* Does it **involve information**?
* Can that information be used to **discover new things** or **solve problems**?

...if so, there are possible coding applications!

### Interest by Demographic

We also investigated the percentage of students who identified an interest, by gender and racial majority/minority demographics as well as by major.

```{r, echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
demographics <- read.csv("demographic.csv")
colnames(demographics) <- c("Interest","Gender Majority","Gender Minority","Racial Majority", "Racial Minority","Major","Non-Major")
datatable(demographics, options = list(
  searching = FALSE,
  pageLength = 15,
  paging=FALSE
  )
)
```
        
#### RQ3. Are there differences in how interested different genders and races are in common CS1 applications?

Common applications in CS1 include **games**, **robots/microcontrollers**, and **media computation**. We evaluated interest in each independently, using chi-square goodness of fit tests to compare proportions of interest between majority and minority students.

1. **Games**
   * Gender majority (n=104, 68%) vs minority (n=15, 36%). Interest was **significantly disproportionate** ($\chi$^2^=5.50, df=1, p<.05).
   * Racial majority (n=76, 64%) vs minority (n=43, 56%). No significant difference ($\chi$^2^=0.50, df=1, p=.48)
2. **Robots/microcontrollers** - evaluated with STEM interests
   * Gender majority (n=55, 36%) vs minority (n=6, 14%). Interest was **significantly disproportionate** ($\chi$^2^=4.87,df=1, p<.05).
   * Racial majority (n=42, 35%) vs minority (n=19, 25%). No significant difference ($\chi$^2^=1.69, df=1, p=.19)
3. **Media computation** - evaluated with Music/film/audio/visuals
   * Gender majority (n=51, 33%) vs minority (n=16, 38%). No significant difference ($\chi$^2^=0.24,df=1, p=.62)
   * Racial majority (n=37, 31%) vs minority (n=30, 39%). No significant difference ($\chi$^2^=0.85, df=1, p=.36).

#### RQ4. Are there interests that uniquely appeal to gender and racial minorities?

* **Gender minority**
  * *Athletics* was the most popular interest
  * *Music/film/audio/visual* and *Arts/crafts* garnered more interest than majority counterparts
* **Racial minority**
  * Proportionate interest in *athletics*, *music/film/audio/visual*, and *arts/crafts*
  * More interest in *reading*, *socializing*, *culinary*, and *sleeping/relaxing* than majority counterparts
 
## Conclusions

* Games and STEM applications may be engaging to the current majority of students
  * *but* emphasis on these applications are not as likely to interest women and other gender minorities. They may even be an *impediment* to broadening participation.
* Interests expressed reinforce that *media computation* is a broadly appealing application of coding
* *Many interests are untapped* in making coding relevant and meaningful
* Future work in broadening participation through examples of more inclusive coding applications that are relevant to students' lives
  * *Coming soon to SIGCSE 2022...*
